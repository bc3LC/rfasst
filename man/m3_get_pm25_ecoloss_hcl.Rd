\arguments{
\item{db_path}{Path to the GCAM database}

\item{query_path}{Path to the query file}

\item{db_name}{Name of the GCAM database}

\item{prj_name}{Name of the rgcam project. This can be an existing project, or, if not, this will be the name}

\item{rdata_name}{Name of the RData file. It must contain the queries in a list}

\item{scen_name}{Name of the GCAM scenario to be processed}

\item{ssp}{Set the ssp narrative associated to the GCAM scenario. c("SSP1","SSP2","SSP3","SSP4","SSP5"). By default is SSP2}

\item{final_db_year}{Final year in the GCAM database (this allows to process databases with user-defined "stop periods")}

\item{mort_model}{Select the health impact model (GBD, GEMM, or FUSION). By default = GBD}

\item{Damage_vsl_range}{Select the VSL to calculate the damages (VSL_med, VSL_low, or VSL_high). By default = VSL_med}

\item{inc_elas_vsl}{Select the VSL to calculate the damages (VSL_med, VSL_low, or VSL_high). By default = VSL_med}

\item{queries}{Name of the GCAM query file. The file by default includes the queries required to run rfasst}

\item{saveOutput}{Writes the emission files.By default=T}

\item{map}{Produce the maps. By default=F}

\item{anim}{If set to T, produces multi-year animations. By default=T}

\item{recompute}{If set to T, recomputes the function output. Otherwise, if the output was already computed once, it uses that value and avoids repeating computations. By default=F}

Economic damages associated with mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure for each TM5-FASST regions for all years (Million$2015). The list of countries that form each region and the full name of the region can be found in Table S2.2 in the TM5-FASST documentation paper: Van Dingenen, R., Dentener, F., Crippa, M., Leitao, J., Marmer, E., Rao, S., Solazzo, E. and Valentini, L., 2018.
