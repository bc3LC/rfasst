\arguments{
\item{db_path}{Path to the GCAM database}

\item{query_path}{Path to the query file}

\item{db_name}{Name of the GCAM database}

\item{prj_name}{Name of the rgcam project. This can be an existing project, or, if not, this will be the name}

\item{prj}{rgcam loaded project}

\item{scen_name}{Vector names of the GCAM scenarios to be processed}

\item{queries}{Name of the GCAM query file. The file by default includes the queries required to run rfasst}

\item{final_db_year}{Final year in the GCAM database (this allows to process databases with user-defined "stop periods")}

\item{saveOutput}{Writes the files.By default=T}

\item{map}{Produce the maps. By default=F}

\item{anim}{If set to T, produces multi-year animations. By default=T}

\item{recompute}{If set to T, recomputes the function output. Otherwise, if the output was already computed once, it uses that value and avoids repeating computations. By default=F}

\item{downscale}{If set to T, produces gridded PM2.5 outputs and plots By default=F}

\item{saveRaster_grid}{If set to T, writes the raster file with weighted PM25 By default=F}

\item{agg_grid}{Re-aggregate (downscaled) gridded data to any provided geometries (shape file). For the moment, only "NUTS3" available}

\item{save_AggGrid}{If set to T, writes the raster file with the reaggregated PM25 By default=F}
