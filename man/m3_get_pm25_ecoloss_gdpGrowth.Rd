\arguments{
\item{db_path}{Path to the GCAM database}

\item{query_path}{Path to the query file}

\item{db_name}{Name of the GCAM database}

\item{prj_name}{Name of the rgcam project. This can be an existing project, or, if not, this will be the name}

\item{prj}{rgcam loaded project}

\item{scen_name}{Vector names of the GCAM scenarios to be processed}

\item{ssp}{Set the ssp narrative associated to the GCAM scenario. c("SSP1","SSP2","SSP3","SSP4","SSP5"). By default is SSP2}

\item{final_db_year}{Final year in the GCAM database (this allows to process databases with user-defined "stop periods")}

\item{mort_model}{Select the health impact model (GBD, GEMM, or FUSION). By default = GBD}

\item{inc_elas}{Select the income elasticity. Normally c(0.8, 1, 1.2). By default = 0.8}

\item{queries}{Name of the GCAM query file. The file by default includes the queries required to run rfasst}

\item{saveOutput}{Writes the emission files.By default=T}

\item{map}{Produce the maps. By default=F}

\item{anim}{If set to T, produces multi-year animations. By default=T}

\item{recompute}{If set to T, recomputes the function output. Otherwise, if the output was already computed once, it uses that value and avoids repeating computations. By default=F}

\item{gcam_eur}{If set to T, considers the GCAM-Europe regions. By default=F}
