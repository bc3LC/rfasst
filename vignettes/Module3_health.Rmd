## Description

The functions in this module estimate adverse health effects attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3; M6M) exposure, measured as premature mortalities, years of life lost (YLLs), and disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The following code shows as an example of two functions to estimate premature mortalities attributable to PM2.5 and the DALYs associated with ozone exposure (M6M). All the functions associated to this module can be found in the [References](https://bc3lc.github.io/rfasst/reference/index.html) page.

```

The calculation of premature mortalities is based on the population-attributable fraction approach as described in [Murray et al. (2003)](https://pophealthmetrics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-7954-1-1). As explained in the TM5-FASST documentation paper ([Van Dingenen et al 2018](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/16173/2018/acp-18-16173-2018-discussion.html)), cause-specific deaths are estimated following the following equation:
$$Mort_{t,r,c,j}=mo_{r,c,j} \cdot ((RR_{c,j}-1)/RR_{c,j})\cdot Pop_{t,r}$$
So premature mortality in period $t$, region $r$, for cause $c$, associated with exposure to pollutant $j$ is calculated as the product between the baseline mortality rate, the change in the RR relative risk of death attributable to a change in population-weighted mean pollutant concentration, and the population exposed.

Mortalities are estimated for six causes, namely stroke, ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute lower respiratory illness diseases ALRI), lung cancer (LC), and diabetes Mellitus Type II (DM). IHD and STROKE are calculated for different age groups, using "age-group-specific" parameters (i.e., mortality rates and RR), while COPD, ALRI, LC and DM are estimated for the whole population exposed (pop > 25 years).

The parameters come from different sources:

* Population exposed is cause-specific. Population fractions are calculated from the from the [SSP database](https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=welcome).

* Cause-specific baseline mortality rates are computed using absolute mortality from the [Global Burden of Disease database](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019) and population statistics (to get exposed population and fractions). The projected changes of these rates over time are taken from the World Health Organization projections [WHO 2013](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/cod_2008_sources_methods.pdf). 

* For O3, relative risk is based on the ERFs from [Jerret et al 2009](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa0803894) and the Global Burden of Disease 2016 ([Turner et al 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26680605/)). For PM2.5, we use three different models to calculate RR:
 - Global Burden of Disease (2018): This method is based on the Integrated Exposure-Response functions (ERFs) from [Burnett et al 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24518036/), with updated and age-group-spefici paraters and the addition of diabetes mellitus type II.
  - GEMM: The Global Exposure Mortality Model ([Burnett et al 2018](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1803222115)) is a PM2.5-mortality hazard ratio function based 41 cohort studies of outdoor air pollution that covers the global exposure range (16 countries).
  - FUSION: FUSION ([Burnett et al 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121015462#abs0010)) is an improved RR model that addresses limitations in previous models.

In addition to general estimates, the package offers an optional feature to estimate health impacts by gender group (female \& male) within each region. While it is recommended to perform overall calculations for consistency, this capability can provide valuable insights into the distribution of health impacts across gender groups within regions. Such granularity can aid users in understanding intra-regional disparities. This feature is activated by setting by_sex = TRUE.


### YLLs and DALYs
Years of life lost and DALYs are estimated by transforming premature mortalities into either YLLs or DALYs using constant ratios (i.e., YLL-to-Mortalities and DALY-to-Mortalities ratios).

These ratios are estimated using the latest available data on mortailities, YLLs, and DALYs from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ([IHME](http://www.healthdata.org/)). These ratios (both for YLLs and for DALYs) are calculated regionally so they differ across regions. For IHD and STROKE, ratios are computed for specific age groups, while they are computed for the whole exposed population for the rest of causes considered (COPD, DM, LRI, and LC)

* `O3_DALY_[scenario]_[year].csv`: Disability-adjusted life years attributable to O3 exposure by region, disease, and model (Jerret2009 and GBD2016)

As in Module 2, for all these functions, the package allows to produce different figures and/or animations, generated using the [rmap](https://github.com/JGCRI/rmap) package documented in the following [page](https://jgcri.github.io/rmap/). To generate these maps, the user needs to include the `map = T` parameter, and they will be generated and stored in the corresponding output sub-directory. As an example for this module, the following map shows the premature mortalities attributable to PM2.5 exposure by cause in 2050. By default, GBD values are taken from the production of the maps.

## Downscaling PM2.5 related premature deaths

The new release of rfasst (rfasst-v2.1) allows the user to get high-resolution (0.01 x 0.01 km) gridded premature deaths maps from PM2.5 outdoor air pollution. 
The gridded maps are based on a static downscaling approach, based on observed PM2.5 data from [Hammer et al 2020](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-global-annual-gwr-pm2-5-modis-misr-seawifs-aod-v4-gl-03) described in the [Module 2 guide](https://bc3lc.github.io/rfasst/articles/Module2_concentration.html#downscaling-pm2-5-concentrations).

The computation is based on the rasterized PM2.5 concentration output, which is combined with the gridded relative risk and population values already loaded in the package to obtain the final gridded output. 

The downscaling procedure can be activated by setting the parameter `downscale = T`. This requires significantly more computing time so it is set to `F` by default. In addition, the updated tool also enables to re-aggregate the gridded output to a new resolution of interest for the user. In this version, the tool only includes to re-aggregate gridded results to the ["NUTS3"](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/99/common-classification-of-territorial-units-for-statistics-nuts-) aggregation by the European Commission. In order to get additional resolutions, the user would need to load their shape file (as a SpatVector object) and make some changes in the corresponding code (Lines 493-527, `m2_conc.R` \& finer updates in `m3_health_grid.R`). Future model version will try to make this procedure more user-friendly, which is a challenge due to the large size of these shape files. The re-aggregation of the gridded data to new resolutions can be activated with the following boolean: `agg_grid = T`. Likewise, the re-aggregated results can be written as a `.csv` file by setting `save_AggGrid = T`.

Note that due to computational constraints, the downscaled output is only available for the total population and cannot be disaggregated by gender.
